# qlearning
A quick example of Q-Learning in a 2D environment

# How to "play"  
Under `src/` there are 2 examples  
  `run.cr`  -- see how the game is played manually.  
  `run_q.cr`  -- run the QLearning agent on the game.  

To run the examples you need [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/docs/installation/)  
Other then that just run `crystal run run*.cr`  and see it plays
